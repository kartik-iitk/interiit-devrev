Had a discussion with ashwin, these are some things that we should try out.

- SPANN for nearest neighbours
- Dense Passage Retrieval : 
    * coCondenser
    * rocketQA
- Information retrieval 
	* uniCOIL
- Contrastive Learning: 
    * simCSE
- PAIR : The learning interpretability tool : https://pair-code.github.io/lit/
- Mixture of Experts (MoE) : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03961.pdf
- BM25 is the default similarity ranking (relevancy) algorithm in Elasticsearch.
- Look at bf16
